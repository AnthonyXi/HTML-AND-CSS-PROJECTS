	<p>Between January 2024 and January 2025, 1,277 new people were identified as homeless in Multnomah County. Meanwhile, only 865 people are categorized as leaving homelessness in that period — either because they moved into housing or they weren’t in contact with any social services or outreach workers within the past 90 days.

Plumb noted that city and county tax dollars currently cover housing for 7,600 people who were previously homeless or at risk of homelessness.</p>
